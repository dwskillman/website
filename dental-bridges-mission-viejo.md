## What Is a Dental Bridge?

**Sub-title: A fixed replacement for missing teeth**

A dental bridge fills the space left by one or more missing teeth. It uses one or more replacement teeth (called pontics) held in place by crowns on the nearby teeth or supported by dental implants. Bridges don’t come in and out like dentures—they stay fixed in your mouth and look just like your natural teeth.

Bridges help you chew food better, speak clearly, and prevent the other teeth in your mouth from moving out of place. They also stop bone loss in the jaw when used with implants, keeping your face shape full and youthful.

## Who Needs a Dental Bridge?

**Sub-title: Best for people missing one or more teeth**

You may need a bridge if you:
- Have one or more missing teeth in a row  
- Want something fixed (not removable)  
- Have healthy teeth on either side of the space (or prefer implant support)  
- Feel uncomfortable eating or speaking due to the gap  
- Don’t want to wait several months for implants to heal

Many patients choose bridges over dentures because they feel more secure and don’t need to be removed at night. For those missing multiple teeth in one area, bridges supported by implants can be a strong and long-term solution.

## Types of Bridges We Offer

**Sub-title: Options based on your needs and smile goals**

There are different kinds of dental bridges, and we help you choose the one that works best for your mouth and lifestyle:

- **Traditional Bridge** – This type uses crowns on the teeth next to the space to hold the new tooth in place. It's the most common kind.  
- **Cantilever Bridge** – Used when there's only one healthy tooth next to the gap.  
- **Maryland Bridge** – Uses a small wing-like framework to bond the replacement tooth behind your existing teeth. Often used for front teeth.  
- **Implant-Supported Bridge** – Ideal for patients missing three or more teeth. The bridge connects to dental implants placed in the jaw.

Each type of bridge can be matched to your natural tooth color, shape, and size so it blends right in.

## How the Dental Bridge Process Works

**Sub-title: 6 simple steps to a stronger, complete smile**

### Step 1: Smile Evaluation  
We check your teeth and gums and take digital images to plan your treatment.

### Step 2: Treatment Planning  
We explain your bridge options, how it works, and what to expect. You’ll get a personalized care plan and timeline.

### Step 3: Tooth Preparation  
If you’re getting a traditional bridge, the nearby teeth are gently shaped to hold crowns. For implant bridges, implants are placed in the jaw.

### Step 4: Impression or Scan  
We take a digital scan or mold of your teeth to create a custom-fit bridge that matches your natural smile.

### Step 5: Temporary Bridge  
A temporary bridge protects your teeth while your final bridge is made at the lab.

### Step 6: Final Placement  
We place and adjust your bridge so it fits securely and comfortably. You’ll leave with a new smile that works and looks great.
