So far this year, I’ve made significant contributions toward elevating the quality, creativity, and impact of our learning experiences, while supporting key business priorities through innovation and collaboration. One standout accomplishment was leading the production of a marketing video for Wells Fargo’s new hire training. This live-action project involved coordinating 10–12 employee volunteers, handling all aspects of recording, and managing post-production to deliver a polished, engaging video that received strong stakeholder praise for its authenticity and effectiveness in onboarding. I also developed a four-part 3D animated video series for applying consumer regulations, where I created custom characters, environments, and lip-synced dialogue animations. The content was recognized for making complex material accessible and visually compelling.

In response to evolving enterprise needs, I produced a high-energy promotional video for the Contact Center as a Service rollout. By blending stock footage with custom motion graphics and advanced rotoscoping, I created a visually dynamic piece that successfully built enthusiasm among employees. Similarly, I contributed custom vector illustrations to support training on electronic and digital communications, enhancing clarity and visual appeal. To scale design quality across the team, I created a reusable animated video intro template for Career Fest, enabling less experienced designers to maintain consistency and elevate over 20 individual videos. Finally, I was tasked with salvaging a high-stakes CSBB College highlights video intended for an executive town hall. Despite the loss of original interview footage, I re-envisioned the project using only audio and still images, delivering a professional, storytelling-driven video that met executive standards under tight constraints.

Collectively, these projects reflect a blend of technical proficiency, creative problem-solving, and a strong focus on enabling others—hallmarks of my contribution to fostering a collaborative, improvement-driven culture and a more engaging, efficient learning experience.


In the months ahead, I plan to focus on strengthening the connection between the creative solutions I develop and the measurable outcomes they’re intended to support. While I’ve received strong feedback from stakeholders, I recognize the value of building in more structured ways to gauge learner engagement and retention—helping ensure that the work not only meets visual and storytelling goals but also drives performance and learning impact.

A key area I’m actively exploring is the development of a shared avatar library, consisting of both 3D and vector-style characters that other instructional designers can easily use in their own projects. I’m currently in the planning and experimental phase, testing styles and workflows that will make the library both versatile and user-friendly. Once complete, this resource will help increase consistency across learning assets and reduce development time for the broader team.

I also see opportunities to improve efficiency by continuing to create scalable design elements like templates and reusable graphics, and I plan to expand my skill set further into real-time 3D and interactive media. Additionally, I want to collaborate more closely with instructional designers and stakeholders earlier in the process, ensuring that creative decisions are aligned with both learning goals and business needs from the start. Ongoing experimentation, feedback, and professional development will remain key drivers of my performance and growth moving forward.



Throughout the first half of the year, I have maintained a strong focus on managing risk in alignment with company expectations, policies, and the broader Risk Management Framework. I consistently adhere to applicable laws, regulations, and internal procedures, particularly when developing learning content that addresses regulatory subjects such as consumer communications or electronic and digital compliance. For example, while producing the Applying Consumer Regulations 3D video series, I ensured all scripts, visuals, and scenarios reflected accurate regulatory interpretation and remained within our communication standards. I routinely engage with stakeholders and compliance partners early in the creative process to surface any potential concerns, confirm alignment, and mitigate risk through appropriate review cycles.

I’ve also taken an active role in managing content integrity by monitoring for potential issues related to representation, accuracy, and brand standards in all visuals and animations. When unexpected challenges arise—such as the unusable footage in the CSBB College Highlights project—I escalate concerns quickly, propose alternative solutions, and collaborate with the appropriate teams to move forward in a compliant and professional manner. I completed all required risk and compliance training on time and regularly reference company guidelines to ensure my projects and decision-making remain well within our defined risk appetite. By embedding a proactive, thoughtful approach to risk into each phase of my design work, I aim to support both creative innovation and operational integrity.


This year, I’ve been proud to contribute to a wide range of high-impact projects that not only showcase my technical and creative strengths, but also support the team’s broader learning and business objectives. From complex 3D animated training content to high-visibility promotional and executive communications, I’ve consistently delivered polished, engaging work that meets tight timelines and evolving expectations. I’ve also demonstrated adaptability and creative problem-solving—whether pivoting in response to challenges or finding new ways to scale design support across the team.

Beyond the deliverables themselves, I’ve made it a priority to support collaboration, share expertise, and experiment with new tools and techniques that can raise the bar for our learning experiences. I remain committed to continuous growth, both in advancing my own capabilities and in contributing to a culture where innovation and quality are standard. I look forward to building on this momentum in the second half of the year.
