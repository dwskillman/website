## Understanding Gum Disease

**Sub-title: Recognizing the signs and risks**

Gum disease begins with plaque buildup, leading to inflammation known as gingivitis. If not addressed, it can progress to periodontitis, causing gum recession, bone loss, and tooth mobility. Early detection is crucial to prevent irreversible damage.

**Common symptoms include:**
- Red, swollen, or tender gums  
- Bleeding during brushing or flossing  
- Persistent bad breath  
- Receding gums or longer-looking teeth  
- Loose or shifting teeth

Ignoring these signs can lead to severe oral health issues and has been linked to systemic conditions like heart disease and diabetes.

- Poor oral hygiene habits  
- Smoking or tobacco use
