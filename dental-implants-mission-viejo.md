## Why Choose Dental Implants?

Dental implants are the gold standard for replacing missing teeth, offering durability, functionality, and aesthetics. Unlike dentures or bridges, implants integrate with your jawbone, preventing bone loss and maintaining facial structure.

**Benefits include:**
- **Longevity:** With proper care, implants can last a lifetime.
- **Natural Appearance:** Designed to look and feel like your natural teeth.
- **Improved Oral Health:** Prevents shifting of adjacent teeth and maintains jawbone integrity.
- **Enhanced Comfort:** Eliminates the discomfort of removable dentures.

1. **Consultation & Evaluation:** Comprehensive oral examination and imaging to assess suitability.
