## What Are Dental Dentures?

**Sub-title: Removable Solutions for Missing Teeth**

Dental dentures are removable appliances designed to replace missing teeth and surrounding tissues. They come in two main types: full dentures for replacing all teeth and partial dentures for replacing some teeth.

Dentures not only restore the appearance of your smile but also improve chewing ability and speech. They are custom-made to fit comfortably and match the natural look of your gums and teeth.
