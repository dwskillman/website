Here are the two decision points from the Processing & Publishing phase, each with a clear title and a very short description of the decision being made:

🔷 Decision: Break/Fix Eligible?
Determine if content qualifies for immediate Break/Fix processing.

🔷 Decision: Pre-Approvals Provided?
Check if required stakeholder approvals are in place.
