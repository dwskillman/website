Step 1: Grass Removal & Irrigation Capping

The first hands-on step is clearing out the existing lawn. Whether it's natural grass, patchy sod, or leftover landscaping — everything needs to come out.

For smaller spaces, you can use a flat shovel to manually cut and lift the sod. It’s more labor-intensive, but gets the job done. For larger yards or high-traffic zones, we highly recommend renting a sod cutter. It gives you consistent depth and will save hours of backbreaking work.

You’ll want to dig down at least two inches, removing both the grass and the topsoil layer. This gives you space to install the base material without raising the turf above surrounding edges like walkways or patios.

Now, as you dig, you’ll likely come across your sprinkler system. Don’t ignore it. Cap off each head or better yet — remove the entire section of PVC piping when possible. Here’s why:

If that system ever turns on again — even by accident — the pressure can burst a line under your turf, eroding the base and creating sink spots that are costly to repair.

Once you cap or remove irrigation, recompact any trenches you’ve dug. Loose soil settles, and if you don’t fix it now, it’ll show later as dips in your turf.

Now take a look at the perimeter of your yard. If you have hard edges like poured concrete, mowing curbs, or stone borders — great. These help hold your turf firmly in place. If not, consider installing bender board, composite edging, or treated lumber now. It’s easier to secure turf to a hard edge than soft soil.

Disposal? Most cities have a green waste dump, where you can take removed sod for a small fee. Avoid tossing it in standard dumpsters — it's heavy, messy, and likely not accepted.

With the grass cleared and irrigation prepped, we’re ready to shape the ground and begin building our turf base.

Step 2: Ground Preparation

With your lawn cleared and irrigation safely capped, it’s time to prepare the ground.

This step is critical for drainage — and drainage is what makes turf last. Poor prep leads to puddling, wrinkles, and turf that shifts or smells over time. Get this right, and your turf will stay beautiful for years.

Start by walking the area and identifying the natural slope. You want water to flow away from your house and toward the street, a drain, or low point. The ideal slope is about 1 to 2 percent — that’s roughly a 1-inch drop for every 5 to 10 feet of length.

Now take a hard rake or landscaping shovel and begin rough grading. Push soil to build a subtle slope if needed. Don’t worry about perfection just yet — we’ll fine-tune this after compacting.

At this stage, remove any large rocks, roots, or buried debris that could interfere with compaction or sit under the turf. Even something as small as a pine cone or chunk of concrete can cause visible bumps once the turf is laid.

Also double-check those irrigation lines and trenches. If you’ve removed any piping or capped sprinkler heads, fill the trenches with soil and compact them thoroughly by hand. Soft spots under turf are the number one cause of future dips.

Use a string line or laser level if you're unsure about slope. Even a long level on a board works well to visualize flow.

Take your time here. Ground prep is the foundation for every step that follows.

Once the ground is graded and clean, we’re ready to bring in the base material — and that starts with quarter minus.

Step 3: Quarter Minus Installation

Now that your ground is prepped and graded, it’s time to install the base layer — and for that, we’re using quarter minus.

Quarter minus is a crushed stone aggregate made up of small rock chips and fine particles. It compacts extremely well, creates a solid foundation, and allows water to drain through while supporting the turf above. It’s the industry standard for artificial turf installations.

Here’s how to calculate how much you’ll need. For every 100 square feet, you’ll need about 1 ton of quarter minus to achieve a 2-inch base.

Use The Turf Yard’s Base Layer Calculator online to get exact numbers based on your project area.

Once delivered, spread the quarter minus in small piles throughout your yard. Don’t try to move the whole pile at once — distributing smaller mounds will make raking more efficient and ensure you don’t end up with high or low spots.

Use a wheelbarrow to move gravel in manageable loads and dump the piles in a grid. This saves your back and keeps the layout even.

The goal here isn’t perfection yet — just coverage. You want a roughly uniform depth of 2 inches across the entire area. It’s okay if it’s not perfectly flat yet — we’ll fine-tune after compaction.

Also, make sure you don’t block any drainage paths. Keep the slope you graded in the previous step visible and follow that shape when distributing your base.

With your base material down, it’s time to spread it out and shape it before locking it in place.

Step 4: Spreading the Quarter Minus

Now that the quarter minus is distributed in small piles across the surface, the next step is to spread and shape the base layer.

Start with a flat shovel or heavy-duty landscape rake, and begin moving material across the surface. Your goal is to create a consistent 2-inch thick base, following the slope you established earlier.

Don’t just eyeball depth. Use a measuring stick or a piece of PVC pipe marked at 2 inches to check your progress. Precision here sets the tone for the rest of the install.

As you rake, work in a consistent direction and break the area into sections. Think of it like frosting a cake—you’re smoothing, shaping, and building your foundation one pass at a time.

Around edges and curves, use a bow rake or even the flat side of a shovel to contour tighter areas. For planters and borders, don’t let the base material pile up too high. It should stop just below the final trim line of your turf.

Leave your base layer about half an inch below hardscape edges like patios or pavers. This keeps the final turf level with those surfaces after infill is applied.

Don’t worry if it looks a little bumpy—we’ll level and compact it next. But at this stage, the base should follow the general slope and shape of your final lawn.

With the gravel evenly spread, we’re ready to compact the base—a step that gives your turf strength, stability, and long-term durability.

Step 5: Compacting the Quarter Minus

With your quarter minus spread evenly across the yard, it’s time to compact the base—and this step is critical.

Compaction creates a solid, stable foundation that prevents the turf from shifting, sagging, or developing soft spots over time. A poorly compacted base is one of the most common reasons for turf failures.

To do it right, you’ll need a motorized plate compactor—not just a hand tamper. You can rent one at most equipment rental stores, or directly from The Turf Yard if you're local. For tight spaces and corners, keep a hand tamper nearby to reach the spots the machine can’t.

Before you start compacting, lightly wet the surface with a hose. Just enough to dampen the gravel—not flood it. This helps the fine particles lock together, making the base denser and stronger.

Run the compactor in multiple passes, moving in different directions—north to south, east to west, and diagonally. Overlap your paths and take your time. The more thorough you are, the better your base will perform.

After the first pass, walk the area and check for low spots. If you find any, add more quarter minus and compact again. It’s normal to go over some areas two or even three times.

You should feel like you're walking on solid ground. If it feels soft underfoot or shifts when you step, it needs more compaction.

Don’t skip compacting around edges. Use your hand tamper to press in the border zones where the plate compactor can’t reach.

When you’re finished, the base should feel firm, level, and dry—almost like concrete but still permeable for drainage.

Now that your base is compacted and solid, let’s fine-tune the surface and dial in the final grade.

Step 6: Final Leveling and Raking

Now that the base is compacted, it's time to fine-tune the surface. This is your final opportunity to perfect the grade before the turf goes down.

Grab a landscape rake or lute and lightly drag it across the surface. Focus on smoothing out ridges, filling low spots, and evening the texture. You’re not moving tons of material anymore—you’re shaping the surface down to the last detail.

Use a straight board or screed in larger areas to drag across the surface and identify dips. If the board rocks or dips, add material underneath and re-rake.

Pay extra attention to the perimeter edges and transition zones—especially around concrete, planter beds, and pavers. These areas tend to build up excess base rock during compacting and need trimming back down to finish grade.

Your goal is to create a base that’s flat but still follows the slope you set earlier. It should guide water away from your home or structures and into appropriate drainage paths.

Use a level or string line to confirm that your surface has a subtle crown or pitch to prevent pooling. Even a 1-inch slope across 10 feet will make a big difference.

Once everything looks and feels right, give it one last walk. If your feet sink, go back and compact that spot again. If it’s solid and smooth—you’re ready for turf.

With the base fully prepped, let’s measure the area one last time to confirm your turf layout and prepare for weed control.

Step 7: Measuring

Before you roll out any turf, double-check your measurements. This step prevents material shortages, costly mistakes, and awkward seams later on.

Start by reviewing your layout. Break your install area into simple shapes—like rectangles or squares—and measure each one. Multiply the length by the width to get the square footage for each section, then add those totals together. For example, if one space is fifteen by twenty feet, that's three hundred square feet. If another area is ten by twelve, that's one hundred and twenty more. Together, that's four hundred and twenty square feet.

Now add ten to fifteen percent to that number to account for trimming, seaming, and waste. This is especially important if your yard has curves, corners, or obstacles like trees or planter beds. So for four hundred and twenty square feet, you’d want to order around four hundred and eighty to five hundred square feet of turf. Having extra gives you flexibility, and it's always better to have a little left over than to come up short.

It’s also a good time to plan where your seams will go. Try to run seams with the grain of the turf, not against it. Fewer seams make for a cleaner look, and it’s best to avoid placing seams in high-traffic areas or focal points if possible.

Once your numbers are confirmed, you’ll use them to determine how much turf to order, how much weed barrier and infill you’ll need, and how many nails or staples to purchase. Write these numbers down or save them in your phone—you’ll refer to them often as you go.

With your measurements confirmed and materials lined up, it’s time to prep the surface to stop unwanted weeds from pushing up through your new lawn.

Step 8: Weed Spraying and Barrier Installation

Now that your base is compacted, leveled, and measured, it’s time to protect the surface from future weed growth. Even though artificial turf blocks light, aggressive weeds like Bermuda grass can still push through if they’re not addressed properly.
Start by spraying a pre-emergent herbicide across the entire area. Use a pump sprayer for even coverage and make sure to treat along edges, seams, and planter borders. The goal here is to kill off any remaining root systems and prevent regrowth under your turf. Give the herbicide a few hours to dry before moving on.
Once the surface is dry, roll out your weed barrier fabric. Start from one end and work your way across the area, overlapping each section by at least six inches. This overlap prevents gaps where weeds could sneak through. If you're working on a slope, lay the fabric horizontally to help it stay in place as you move.
Use six-inch landscape staples or turf nails to pin the fabric every few feet. You don’t need to overdo it—just enough to keep it from shifting while you install the turf. Cut holes in the fabric for any drain boxes, tree wells, or utilities that need to stay exposed. Take your time here—clean barrier installation sets the stage for a clean turf layout.
Some installers skip the barrier and rely solely on herbicide. Others use just fabric. But for the best long-term results, especially in warmer climates or areas with aggressive grass, using both methods together gives you the strongest defense.
With weed protection in place, you’re now ready to start laying out the turf.

Step 9: Turf Layout

With your base complete and weed barrier in place, it’s time to lay out your turf. Artificial turf typically comes in rolls that are 15 or 12 feet wide. These rolls are delivered to your site and need to be staged in an open, accessible area. The Turf Yard will assist with offloading your turf to help ensure it arrives safely and is positioned for easy handling. The best place to stage the rolls is a driveway, patio, or another flat open surface that allows for unrolling and cutting without obstructions. Start by referencing your earlier measurements to determine which roll goes where. Unroll each section and use a sharp utility knife to make initial cuts—always cutting from the back side of the turf where you can clearly see the stitch rows. This gives you better accuracy and control. Cut each piece slightly larger than its intended area, leaving a few extra inches on all sides. Make sure each piece has enough overlap along all edges—this includes not just seams between turf pieces but also the outer perimeter. This extra material will allow you to make precise final cuts during trimming and help ensure a tight, clean fit against curbs, planter beds, or concrete. Once each piece is cut to rough size, carefully carry it to its designated area and position it loosely in place. Don’t worry about stretching or final alignment yet—this step is all about getting each section close to where it belongs, oriented with the blades all facing in the same direction. This is also a good time to allow the turf to relax. If it’s been tightly rolled or if the weather is cool, let it sit in the sun for 30 to 60 minutes. This softens the backing and helps the turf conform to the base during the next stages of installation.

Step 10: Cutting the Turf

With each turf piece roughly positioned and overlapping correctly, it’s time to begin stretching the turf and securing it temporarily to hold its shape. Start with one corner of your layout. Pull the turf into that corner until it’s snug, then drive a few six-inch turf nails through the backing into the base to anchor it temporarily. This holds the turf in place while you stretch the opposite side. Repeat this process at the remaining corners—stretching across the area and pinning each corner one by one. This creates uniform tension across the turf and helps eliminate folds or loose areas. Continue working around the perimeter, lightly pulling the turf taut and adding a few nails along the edges. These nails don’t need to be fully set yet—they’re just there to prevent shifting as you move through the remaining steps. The final nailing will come after the turf is seamed, trimmed, and fully stretched. As you go, be sure the turf grain stays consistent throughout all pieces. The blades should lean in the same direction to keep the appearance uniform. Make any slight adjustments before moving on. Stretching and anchoring at this stage is critical—it helps hold tension, defines the shape of your layout, and sets the turf up for clean seaming and trimming. Once all corners are anchored and the turf is tensioned into position, you're ready to begin precision cutting around the perimeter.

Step 11: Installing and Positioning the Turf

Now that the turf is properly stretched and anchored in place, it’s time to begin cutting around the edges to match the exact shape of your yard. This is your final trim before securing the entire perimeter. Use a sharp utility knife or turf shears and always cut from the back side of the turf, where you can clearly follow stitch rows and backing lines. This allows for clean, accurate cuts without damaging the turf blades. Work along the perimeter—starting at a clear edge like a patio, driveway, or mow strip—and trim the turf so it ends about one-eighth of an inch from the hard surface. That small gap helps prevent fraying and allows the fibers to stand naturally against the edge without bunching. For curved edges or corners, make a series of small relief cuts. This allows the turf to bend around the shape without folding or lifting. Take your time here—precision in this step will have the biggest impact on the overall finish. If you encounter obstacles like drain boxes, tree trunks, or fence posts, make a rough outline cut first and then go back with smaller blades or hand clippers to shape the turf tightly around those objects. Be sure the turf sits flush with no gaps or raised edges. Check each area after trimming to confirm that the turf lays flat and follows the shape of your yard perfectly. Walk the edges and gently press them down by hand to seat the turf into the base. Once trimming is complete and everything is resting naturally, you’re ready to move on to seaming the turf for a seamless finish.

Step 12: Stretching the Turf

With each piece of turf now fully trimmed and positioned, the next step is to seam the adjoining sections together. Start by folding back the edges where two pieces overlap. You should have about six inches of overlap between each piece. Use a sharp utility knife to cut through both layers simultaneously using an S-curve or wave cut. This shape helps disguise the seam by breaking up straight lines and allowing the turf blades to blend more naturally. Once the excess is removed, lay both pieces back down and ensure they align with a small gap—about one-eighth of an inch. This narrow space prevents bunching and gives the blades room to blend without pressure from the backing. Next, lay out your seam tape underneath the joint, centered between both pieces. At The Turf Yard, we use nails instead of glue to secure our seams. Glue can block drainage and become brittle over time, whereas nails offer long-lasting hold without compromising performance. Using six-inch turf nails, start at one end of the seam and alternate sides, driving a nail every four to six inches. Drive the nails through the backing—not the turf blades—and make sure the turf lies flat across the seam tape. Gently brush the seam with your hand or a soft broom to blend the blades and lift any that may have been pressed down during nailing. Step back and check the seam from different angles and in natural light. If it’s barely visible, you’ve done it right. If you can still see a clear line, make small adjustments and brush until the fibers blend completely. Once your seams are done, you’ve successfully joined your turf pieces into a single, continuous surface. Up next—trimming the perimeter and permanently securing the edges.

Step 13: Seaming the Turf

Now that your turf is stretched and aligned, it’s time to seam the pieces together. A clean, invisible seam is one of the most important parts of a professional-looking install.
Begin by folding back both edges of the turf where they meet. Check the cut lines—each edge should be clean, straight, and free of fraying. If necessary, recut the seam edge to clean it up. You want the gap between the two pieces to be about one eighth of an inch. This gives the fibers space to move and blend naturally without overlapping or creating a visible line.
At The Turf Yard, we use a method called the S-seam. It involves cutting a soft wave pattern into the adjoining edges rather than a straight line. This helps camouflage the seam by blending the blades in different directions. It’s especially useful in high-visibility areas or when working with lighter-colored turf.
Once your edges are shaped and aligned, lay a strip of turf seam tape along the ground between them. Make sure it’s centered and extends beyond both sides of the seam. Press the turf edges down onto the tape and make minor adjustments to line everything up.
Instead of glue, which can be messy and limit drainage, we recommend seaming with six-inch turf nails. Start at one end of the seam and alternate nails every four to six inches, placing them about a quarter inch from the edge of the turf. Drive them straight down through the backing—not through the blades. Once both sides are secured, gently brush the seam with your hand or a stiff broom to blend the fibers.
Step back and check your work from different angles. A properly done seam should disappear into the rest of the turf. If you can see it clearly, pause and adjust. Most issues at this stage come from poor alignment, over-trimming, or blades being pushed down during install.
Once the seam is complete and blended, you’re ready to move on to trimming the perimeter.

Step 14: Trim Edges Around the Perimeter

With the turf stretched and seamed, the next step is to trim around the edges of the yard to create a clean, finished look. This includes any borders, planter beds, curbs, fences, or concrete edges that define your space.
Start by folding back the turf slightly along the edge so you can see the line where you want the cut to land. Using a sharp utility knife with a fresh blade, cut from the back of the turf along the edge of the hardscape or bender board. Always take your time and make shallow passes. Rushing this step or cutting too deep can cause jagged edges or accidental overcuts.
For curved borders, make small relief cuts every few inches as you go. This allows the turf to bend smoothly around the shape without buckling. Trim a little, reposition, then trim again. Don’t try to force a long curved cut in one motion—it won’t come out clean.
If you’re working around objects like trees, irrigation boxes, or light poles, make a rough cut first, then go back and fine-tune it with smaller detail cuts. The goal is to get the turf sitting tight and flush with no large gaps or lifted corners.
Once all the edges are trimmed, step back and inspect the entire perimeter. The turf should follow the yard’s shape exactly, with clean transitions and no excess material bunched up along the edges.
This step can take time, but it’s what gives your project a professional finish. Precise perimeter cuts make everything look intentional, smooth, and complete.
Now that your turf is shaped perfectly to your yard, it’s time to secure those edges permanently.

Step 15: Nailing the Edges

With your turf trimmed and fitted perfectly to the shape of your yard, the next step is to secure the perimeter. This locks the turf in place and prevents it from shifting or lifting over time.
Start by driving six-inch turf nails through the backing along all outer edges. Place the nails every four to six inches, spacing them evenly. Avoid nailing directly through seams or angled cuts. Instead, focus on securing the edges firmly where the turf meets concrete, curbing, or any edging material you’ve installed.
As you drive each nail, gently spread the turf blades apart with your fingers. This helps you avoid pinching or trapping fibers under the nail head. Once the nail is fully seated, brush the blades back over the top so the head disappears. The goal is a secure hold that’s invisible to the eye.
Work in sections, starting from one corner and moving methodically around the yard. For curved areas, place nails closer together if needed to maintain shape and hold tension along the arc.
After securing the edges, do a quick walk-around. Tug lightly on the turf to check for any loose spots or lifted corners. If anything feels soft or unsecured, add another nail or two in that area.
Once the perimeter is locked down, grab your hand tamper and press around the entire edge. This compresses the turf into the base and ensures a tight bond between the turf and the ground. You want everything to feel flat, flush, and anchored.
When the edges are nailed, tamped, and blended, your turf is officially in place. Now it’s time to give it structure, weight, and durability with infill.

Step 16: Infill Application

With your turf fully installed and nailed down, the next step is applying infill. Infill gives the turf weight, keeps the blades standing upright, and improves the way the turf feels and functions over time. Without infill, turf can flatten out, shift underfoot, or become uneven.

The most common types of infill are silica sand and coated sand. Silica sand is great for general installs because it’s clean, affordable, and provides excellent support. If you have pets, consider using an antimicrobial infill or a deodorizing option designed to reduce odor and bacteria buildup.

To apply the infill, use a drop spreader—the same kind used for lawn fertilizer. Fill the spreader with your infill and walk slowly across the turf, releasing an even layer as you go. Avoid dumping infill in piles or spreading it by hand. Uneven application can lead to low spots or clumping, which affects both the appearance and the feel of the turf.

The general recommendation is one to two pounds of infill per square foot, depending on the turf style and blade height. Thicker turf may require more infill to support the blades properly. After the first pass, check for thin or bare areas and make a second pass if needed.

Once the infill is applied, lightly mist the surface with water. This helps the infill settle and reduces any dust during brushing. Be careful not to overwater—just a light spray to help everything drop into place.

Now that your turf has structure and weight, it’s time to brush the blades upright and bring your new lawn to life.

Step 17: Brushing the Turf

Now that the infill is in place, it’s time to brush the turf. This step lifts the blades, distributes the infill evenly, and gives the lawn a full, natural appearance. It’s also the first time your turf will start looking like a finished yard.

Start with a stiff-bristled push broom or, for a faster and more consistent result, use a powered turf brush. These machines lift the blades more effectively and help level the infill across larger areas. If you don’t own one, you can rent a powered turf brush directly from The Turf Yard for your own installation.

Brush against the grain of the turf blades. This means brushing in the opposite direction from how the blades naturally lean. Brushing this way helps the blades stand upright and separates them from the infill sitting between the fibers. As you work, you’ll notice the color of the turf deepen and the texture appear fuller.

Move in rows, brushing each section thoroughly before moving to the next. Take your time around seams and borders, which tend to trap infill and need extra attention to blend smoothly. If you find any areas where the blades are matted or laying flat, focus more brushing there to restore the upright shape.

As you go, keep an eye out for low spots in the infill. If you find any, stop and add a little more infill, then continue brushing until it’s evenly distributed. The goal is a smooth, consistent surface with uniform color and feel.

Once the entire area is brushed, walk the install and check from multiple angles. Touch up any spots where the grain looks off or where the infill is uneven.

Brushing is more than just visual—it helps secure the infill, improves durability, and enhances the overall look of your finished turf.

With brushing complete, you’re ready for the final walkthrough and detail cleanup.

Step 18: Final Trim and Detailing

Now that your turf is brushed and the infill is settled, the final step is all about refining the edges. This is where the project goes from installed to impressive.

Start by grabbing a pair of sharp hand clippers or heavy-duty grass shears. These give you better control than a utility knife when working close to hard surfaces like walkways, patios, concrete curbs, or bender board.

Carefully trim along every edge where the turf meets a hard border. Use slow, steady cuts to shape the turf right to the edge without fraying or leaving excess backing exposed. The goal is to get the turf fibers to end just short of the hard surface, so they stand up straight and clean against it without folding over.

For curving edges, make short overlapping snips to match the shape smoothly. If the turf is slightly bunching or rising at corners, use the clippers to relieve small tension points in the backing. This lets the turf lay flatter and follow the natural curve of the landscape.

This is also the time to check around planter wells, drain boxes, and fence posts. If turf was cut rough earlier, now’s the time to go back and shape those cuts more precisely. Tight, rounded cuts make a huge difference in the overall appearance.

Once all edges are trimmed, take your broom and gently brush the perimeter inward. This fluffs up the blades that may have been pressed during trimming and gives your lawn that crisp, well-finished look.

As a final touch, mist the turf lightly with water. This helps any remaining dust from the infill settle into the blades and gives the turf a natural sheen.

Taking a few extra minutes on these finishing details is what separates a weekend project from a professionally finished lawn. When done right, your artificial turf should blend seamlessly into the landscape and hold that clean edge for years.
