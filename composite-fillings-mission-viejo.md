## What Are Composite Fillings?

**Sub-title: Tooth-colored fillings that repair decay and damage**

Composite fillings are made from a blend of plastic resin and tiny glass particles. They are used to repair teeth that have cavities, chips, or wear—and are shaded to match your natural tooth color. Unlike old metal fillings, composites bond directly to the tooth, helping support and strengthen its structure.

They are ideal for small to medium-sized restorations and are most often used in front and back teeth where appearance matters.

## Who Needs a Composite Filling?

**Sub-title: A great choice for both new cavities and replacements**

You might need a composite filling if you:

- Have a new cavity in a tooth  
- Want to replace an old silver or metal filling  
- Have a chipped or worn-down tooth  
- Want a mercury-free and more aesthetic solution

Composite fillings are popular among both adults and kids. They are especially helpful when fixing teeth in the smile zone where appearance is important.

## Why Choose Composite Over Metal Fillings?

**Sub-title: More natural, more protective, and less invasive**

Composite fillings offer several advantages compared to metal (amalgam) fillings:

- **Looks natural** – They're nearly invisible once placed  
- **Bond to tooth structure** – Which means less drilling  
- **No temperature sensitivity** – Unlike metal, composites don’t expand or contract with heat or cold  
- **Mercury-free** – A safer option for patients looking to avoid metals

We’ll help you decide if composite is the best option for your tooth based on its size, location, and your overall goals.

## How the Composite Filling Process Works

**Sub-title: A quick and comfortable 6-step procedure**

### Step 1: Exam and X-rays  
We check your tooth and take images to confirm the cavity or damage.

### Step 2: Numbing the Area  
We gently numb the area to make sure you're fully comfortable during treatment.

### Step 3: Removing the Decay  
The damaged or decayed part of your tooth is removed with precision tools.

### Step 4: Cleaning and Preparation  
We clean the space and prepare it so the filling bonds securely to your tooth.

### Step 5: Placing the Composite  
We apply layers of resin, shape it, and harden it using a special curing light.

### Step 6: Finishing and Polishing  
Your filling is trimmed, polished, and checked for a perfect bite and smooth feel.

## Caring for Your Composite Fillings

**Sub-title: Keep your fillings strong with these simple habits**

Composite fillings don’t require any special care beyond normal hygiene. Just:

- Brush twice a day and floss daily  
- Avoid biting down on very hard items (like ice or pens)  
- Visit us for regular cleanings and checkups  
- Wear a nightguard if you grind your teeth

With good care, composite fillings can last many years.
