## What Is a Dental Crown?

**Sub-title: A cap to restore the shape and strength of your tooth**

A dental crown is a tooth-shaped cap that completely covers a damaged or decayed tooth. It’s custom-made to match the size, shape, and color of your natural teeth. Crowns are a durable solution to restore function to a tooth that’s weakened by decay, large fillings, or cracks.

Crowns help prevent further damage to the tooth, allowing you to chew comfortably again while protecting it from future wear and tear. They are often used for teeth that have undergone root canal therapy or for teeth that are cracked or severely worn down.

## Who Needs a Dental Crown?

**Sub-title: Ideal for patients with damaged or weakened teeth**

Dental crowns are often recommended if you:

- Have a tooth with a large cavity that can’t be filled  
- Need to protect a tooth after a root canal procedure  
- Have a cracked or broken tooth that needs support  
- Want to improve the appearance of a misshapen or discolored tooth

Crowns are also commonly used for restoring teeth with extensive fillings and those that are vulnerable to damage.

## Types of Dental Crowns We Offer

**Sub-title: Options based on your needs and smile goals**

- **Porcelain Crowns** – These are the most aesthetic option and blend well with natural teeth. They’re ideal for front teeth.  
- **Zirconia Crowns** – A strong, durable option, perfect for back teeth.  
- **Porcelain-Fused-to-Metal Crowns** – These offer strength and aesthetics, as the metal provides durability while the porcelain blends with the natural tooth color.  
- **Metal Crowns** – Made of gold or other metal alloys, these are the strongest type but are typically used in the back of the mouth where they are less visible.

## How the Dental Crown Procedure Works

**Sub-title: 6 steps to a stronger, restored tooth**

### Step 1: Consultation & Exam  
We evaluate your tooth, take X-rays, and discuss your goals to choose the best crown option for you.

### Step 2: Tooth Preparation  
We shape the tooth by removing any decayed or damaged parts, leaving enough tooth structure for the crown to fit securely.

### Step 3: Impressions or Scans  
A detailed impression or digital scan is taken to create a custom crown that fits perfectly.

### Step 4: Temporary Crown  
While your permanent crown is being made, we’ll place a temporary crown to protect your tooth.

### Step 5: Final Crown Placement  
Once the crown is ready, we place it, check the fit and color, and make any necessary adjustments.

### Step 6: Bonding & Adjustment  
The final crown is securely bonded to your tooth, and we ensure it fits comfortably with your bite.
