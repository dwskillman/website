## The Importance of Regular Teeth Cleanings

**Sub-title: Essential for prevention and early detection**

Skipping dental cleanings allows plaque and tartar to harden into calculus, a leading cause of gum disease and tooth loss. Cleanings every six months help protect your enamel, detect early signs of decay, and keep your breath fresh. For patients with gum disease, more frequent deep cleanings (scaling and root planing) may be recommended.

## What Is Professional Teeth Cleaning?

**Sub-title: A preventative hygiene service**

Teeth cleaning, also called prophylaxis, is a routine dental procedure that removes plaque, calculus, and stains from your teeth. It’s typically performed by a licensed dental hygienist and includes polishing, flossing, and a fluoride rinse.

## Who Should Get Their Teeth Cleaned?

**Sub-title: Everyone, especially those at higher risk**

Dental cleanings are important for children, teens, adults, and seniors. You may benefit from more frequent cleanings if you have:

- Bleeding or inflamed gums  
- A history of gum disease  
- Dry mouth or medications that cause it  
- Orthodontics like braces or aligners  
- Diabetes or cardiovascular disease

## How the Teeth Cleaning Process Works

**Sub-title: From check-in to fresh smile**

### Step 1: Oral Exam  
Your hygienist inspects your mouth for signs of decay, gum inflammation, or abnormal tissue.

### Step 2: Plaque & Tartar Removal  
We use hand scalers and ultrasonic tools to clean along your gumline and between your teeth.

### Step 3: Polishing  
A gritty polish removes surface stains and smooths your enamel.

### Step 4: Flossing  
Professional flossing dislodges particles and plaque between teeth.

### Step 5: Fluoride Treatment (Optional)  
A fluoride gel may be applied to strengthen enamel and reduce sensitivity.

## Maintaining Oral Health Between Visits

**Sub-title: Tips to keep your smile healthy year-round**

Your daily habits make all the difference. Brush twice daily with fluoride toothpaste, floss once a day, and drink plenty of water. Limiting sugary snacks and acidic drinks will also protect your enamel.
