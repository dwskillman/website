## What Is a Tooth Extraction?

**Sub-title: Removing a tooth to protect your health**

A tooth extraction is the removal of a tooth from its socket in the bone. While we always try to save a tooth first, there are times when extraction is the best option. Common reasons include severe decay, infection, trauma, overcrowding, or advanced gum disease.

We perform both simple and surgical extractions, depending on the condition of the tooth and its position in the mouth. Our team uses local anesthesia and careful techniques to make the process as smooth and pain-free as possible.

## Who Needs a Tooth Extraction?

**Sub-title: When saving the tooth isn’t possible**

You may need an extraction if:

- Your tooth is badly decayed or broken and can’t be fixed  
- You have a painful infection or abscess that hasn’t responded to treatment  
- You’re preparing for orthodontic treatment and need to create space  
- You have wisdom teeth that are impacted or causing problems  
- Gum disease has loosened your teeth

Tooth extractions can help prevent bigger problems, like bone loss, damage to surrounding teeth, or serious infections.

## Types of Tooth Extractions We Perform

**Sub-title: Tailored treatment based on your needs**

- **Simple Extractions** – Used when the tooth is fully visible and easy to remove. We gently loosen the tooth and lift it out.  
- **Surgical Extractions** – Needed for teeth that are broken off at the gum line or haven’t fully erupted (like impacted wisdom teeth). These require a small incision and sometimes sectioning the tooth for safe removal.

We’ll explain your options and make sure you feel informed and confident before the procedure.

## How the Tooth Extraction Process Works

**Sub-title: 6 simple steps from exam to recovery**

### Step 1: Exam and X-rays  
We check the tooth and surrounding area to confirm that extraction is the best option.

### Step 2: Treatment Planning  
We go over your medical history and explain the process, risks, and recovery details.

### Step 3: Numbing the Area  
Local anesthesia is applied to keep the area completely numb during the procedure.

### Step 4: Tooth Removal  
We gently loosen the tooth and remove it with minimal pressure and discomfort.

### Step 5: Gauze and Aftercare  
We place gauze to stop bleeding and provide full instructions for healing at home.

### Step 6: Follow-Up Support  
We schedule a follow-up if needed and remain available for questions during your recovery.

## Aftercare for a Tooth Extraction

**Sub-title: Healing quickly and safely at home**

After your extraction, it’s important to:

- Bite down on gauze for 30–45 minutes to control bleeding  
- Avoid rinsing or using a straw for the first 24 hours  
- Stick to soft foods and stay hydrated  
- Keep the area clean, but avoid brushing near the site for the first day  
- Call us if you notice swelling, severe pain, or unusual bleeding

We’ll give you printed instructions and explain everything before you leave.
