## Understanding Dental Veneers

**Sub-title: A versatile solution for various dental imperfections**

Dental veneers are thin, custom-made shells crafted from porcelain or composite resin that cover the front surface of teeth. They are ideal for addressing:

- Discolored or stained teeth  
- Chipped or broken teeth  
- Gaps between teeth  
- Misaligned or irregularly shaped teeth

By choosing veneers, you can achieve a uniform, bright, and natural-looking smile.

## The Veneer Procedure at Saddleback Dental

**Sub-title: From consultation to confident smile**

### Step 1: Initial Consultation  
We begin with a comprehensive examination to assess your dental health and discuss your aesthetic goals.

### Step 2: Tooth Preparation  
A minimal amount of enamel is gently removed from the tooth surface to accommodate the veneer.

### Step 3: Impression Taking  
We take precise impressions of your teeth to create custom veneers that fit perfectly.

### Step 4: Temporary Veneers  
Temporary veneers may be placed to protect your teeth while the permanent ones are being fabricated.

### Step 5: Veneer Placement  
Once ready, the permanent veneers are bonded to your teeth, and final adjustments are made for optimal fit and appearance.
